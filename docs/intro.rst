What is the VRE?
----------------

"VRE" refers to the "Virtual Research Environment" being developed for ESA's *Aeolus* mission. This will be a cloud service to enable easy usage of *Aeolus* data, based on the open source *Jupyter* technology.

- VirES (**Vir**\ tual Workspaces for **E**\ arth Observation **S**\ cientists) graphical interface (GUI): https://aeolus.services
- VRE (**V**\ irtual **R**\ esearch **E**\ nvironment)

JupyterLab runs in the cloud and enables you to login and run code directly through a web browser without any software needing to be installed on your machine. Data and software are all stored and executed in the cloud. We provide a curated Python environment (i.e. a collection of installed packages) to support scientific activities related to *Aeolus*, with the aim of reliably and easily sharing code between users and stimulating the development of open source software related to Aeolus.


Aeolus data can be explored graphically through the web client (https://aeolus.services), or in the future programmatically through JupyterLab.


Getting access
--------------

More information will be available once VRE service is ready.
